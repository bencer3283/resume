            \item In this work, I designed a shape-transforming device called TeleSHift with a 3D tangible user interface (TUI) for group-based collaboration.
            \item The design process involved extensive modeling of the mechanical design (SolidWorks), iterative improvements to design for manufacturability (reducing assembling time of the prototype to 1/5) and FDM rapid-prototyping as well as the control circuit.

            \item I developed a novel spectral mapping system called HSI that vastly acclerate the workflow of spectral measurement reserch in the institute. (Ex. up to 26\% reduction in scanning time.)
            \item By being involved in several research project in the institute, I was able to understand the needs and bottleneck of current workflow and to develop a one-stop, integrated solution. 
            \item Techincal aspect: software dev., image processing and system integration. 
            \item I was awarded the \textbf{2021 Technology Innovation Award} by CCMS, NTU and \textbf{College Student Research Creativity Award} by National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan (USD\$660) with this product, HSI.
