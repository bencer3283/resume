        \begin{itemize}
            \item I hosted workshops in topics like IoT client design with ESP32, server HTTP API development and UI development.
            I also work with course teachers to host specific workshops that tailors to their course needs.
            %\item I manage the inventory of various electronics components in the E-Lab.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item In this work, I designed a shape-transforming device called TeleSHift with a 3D tangible user interface (TUI) for group-based collaboration.
            \item I laid out the system architecture of the presented prototype in this work with ESP32 microcontroller and a Firebase cloud server. I also implemented the mechanical design (SolidWorks) and power supply circuit of the prototype.
            \item Additionally, my design for manufacturability (DFM) improvements helped reducing assembling time of the prototype to only 1/5.

        %UX survey, mechanics design
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I interviewed 50 students to understand their needs for gaming keyboard and identified an opportunity for innovation then designed three prototypes to demonstrate it.
            \item I designed a microcontroller circuit to control a stepper motor and a self-designed electromagnet. Besides, my skills in statistics with R for the UX survey, modeling with Creo and SLA/FDM prototyping were also demonstrated.
            \item I gained strong familiarity with NPI (New Product Introduction) process in the tech industry while collaborating with many departments (PM, EE, ID) in the company.

        %Software development, system integration
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I developed a proprietary software using C++ and LavVIEW to integrates several electronics/optical components like imaging sensors (EMCCD) to form a novel microscopic spectral mapping system. %\newline \href{https://bencer3283.github.io/experiences/collegeStudentResearch/}{\underline{Details linked here.}}
            \item By researching the readout sequence of the EMCCD used in the system and optimizing the algorithm, I reduced the scanning time by 26\%.
            \item By being involved in several research projects in the institute, I was able to understand the needs and bottleneck of existing workflow and to develop a one-stop, integrated solution.
            \item I was awarded the \textbf{2021 Technology Innovation Award} by CCMS, NTU and \textbf{College Student Research Creativity Award} by National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan (USD\$660) with this project.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item I designed an IoT machine to monitor the amount of bugs in farm fields including its microcontroller PCB and mechanics.
            \item I created a git-based collaboration workflow for SolidWorks and a Notion-based BOM managment system to help me track quotes from vendors as well as the changes in design.
            \item Technical aspect involved automation, IoT with Arduino (XBee), PCB design (Altium), SolidWorks, MySQL.
