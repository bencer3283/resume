        \begin{itemize}
            \item In this work, I designed a shape-transforming device called TeleSHift with a 3D tangible user interface (TUI) for group-based collaboration.
            \item I laid out the system architecture of the presented prototype in this work with ESP32 microcontroller, potentiometers, DC motors, etc. I also implemented the mechanical design (SolidWorks) and power supply circuit of the prototype.
            \item Additionally, my design for manufacturability (DFM) improvements helped reducing assembling time of the prototype to only 1/5.
