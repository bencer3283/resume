        UX survey, mechanics design
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Feb. - Jun. 2022
            \item I proposed an innovative keyboard switch, then conducted a UX survey with 50 interviewees to understand its target audience and lastly designed three working prototype to demonstrate the technology.
            \item Besides statistics with R for the UX survey, my engineering capabilities including modeling with Creo, SLA/3DP prototyping, electromagnet and microcontroller circuits design and stepper motor control were involved.
            \item I gained strong familiarity with the NPI (New Product Introduction) process in the tech industry while collaborating with many departments (PM, EE, ID) in the company.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item I conducted a market survey with $\sim$700 samples and used regression analysis to understand how customer's preferences for online video streaming platform changed during the pandemic.
            \item We showed a surprising results that customers didn't find those platforms more appealing despite the pandemic forcing them to use those platforms more.
